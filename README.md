# SM-Protocol
- <b>What is this?</b> A protocol that standardizes the abstraction of SaaS product offerings.
- <b>Why should I care?</b> SaaS product offering is becoming increasingly hard to evaluate.
- <b>How does it work?</b> Implement the protocol via XML manifest file in website root.

<b>Background:</b>
- Computation is a commodity.
- IaaS companies make computation ubiquitous and affordable. 
- <i><b>SaaS companies sell computation at the cost of abstraction.</b></i> 
- App companies buy abstraction, integrate and re-package it into end-user-products.

"Protocols are essential to ensuring that devices can communicate and exchange data with each other effectively and reliably.
Without protocols, it would be difficult or impossible for devices to understand each other and transmit data successfully."

<b>Goal:</b>
Create a SaaS product offering abstraction protocol that could ensure that SaaS marketing sites can communicate and exchange data with each other - and with the humans parsing them - effectively and reliably.

<b>Use cases:</b>
- Sitemap ( /features, /compare, /industry, /security, /cookies, etc.)
- Comparison (PlanetScale vs Neon, Axiom vs Datadog vs Honeycomb, Auth0 vs Octa, etc.)
- Compatibility Audits ( SOC 2, iso27001, GDPR, etc.)
- Much more...
