# SM-Protocol
- <b>What is this?</b> A protocol that standardizes SaaS product offering.
- <b>Why should I care?</b> SaaS product offering is becoming increasingly hard to evaluate.
- <b>How does it work?</b> Implement a protocol manifest file in site root that can be parsed by a crawler.

<b>Background:</b>
- Computation is a commodity.
- IaaS makes computation ubiquitous and affordable. 
- SaaS sells computation at the cost of abstraction. 
- App companies buy and integrate abstraction into product offering.

"Protocols are essential to ensuring that devices can communicate and exchange data with each other effectively and reliably.
Without protocols, it would be difficult or impossible for devices to understand each other and transmit data successfully."

<b>Goal:</b>
Create a product offering protocol that could be essential to ensuring that marketing websites can communicate and exchange data with each other and with the humans parsing them, effectively and reliably.

<b>Use cases</b>
- Sitemap ( /features, /compare, /industry, /security, /cookies, etc.)
- Comparison (PlanetScale vs Neon, Axiom vs Datadog vs Honeycomb, Auth0 vs Octa, etc.)
- Audits ( SOC 2, iso27001, GDPR, etc.)
- Much more...
